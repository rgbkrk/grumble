# grumble

A little collection of experiments that use nteract node.js libraries for interfacing with Jupyter.

## Requirements

* Node.js 8.x

## Develop

### Install

```
git clone https://github.com/rgbkrk/grumble
cd grumble
npm install
```

### Try It

If you run

```
npm run dev
```

after running the install steps above, a little nbconvert-like demo is run, executing each of the cells in `hsl-wow.ipynb`. Each of the Jupyter messages are logged to the console in a slightly alright way to read them.
